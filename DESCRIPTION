Description: Monitoring reporting rates of subject-level clinical events (e.g.
  adverse events, protocol deviations) reported by clinical trial sites is an
  important aspect of risk-based quality monitoring strategy. Sites that are 
  under-reporting or over-reporting events can be detected using bootstrap
  simulations during which patients are redistributed between sites. Site-specific
  distributions of event reporting rates  are generated that are used to assign
  probabilities to the observed reporting rates.
