Description: This can detect clinical trial sites that are under-reporting adverse events (AE).
  Bootstrap-based simulations are used to simulate AE reporting and to assign an AE 
  under-reporting probability to each site in a clinical trial (Koneswarakantha 2021 
  <doi:10.1007/s40264-020-01011-5>).
