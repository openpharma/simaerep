Description: Monitoring of Adverse Event (AE) reporting in clinical trials is 
  important for patient safety. Sites that are under-reporting AEs can be detected 
  using Bootstrap-based simulations that simulate overall AE reporting. Based on the 
  simulation an AE under-reporting probability is assigned to each site in a 
  given trial (Koneswarakantha 2021 <doi:10.1007/s40264-020-01011-5>).
