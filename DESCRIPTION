Description: Monitoring of Adverse Event (AE) reporting in clinical trials is important for patient safety. We
  use bootstrap-based simulation to assign an AE under-reporting probability to each site in a clinical trial.
  The method is inspired by the 'infer' R package and Allen Downey's blog article: "There is only one test!"
  (http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/05/there-is-only-one-test.html).
