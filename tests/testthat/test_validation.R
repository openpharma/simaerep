# The principles of the algorithm have been published and peer reviewed thus the
# statistical core principles are out of scope of the validation.
#
# Instead we will formulate expectations from the stakeholders point of view for
# which we will then write validation test cases:
#
# We expect that sites that report fewer AEs than other sites in the same study
# have higher AE under-reporting probabilities. We expect that sites with high
# AE under-reporting probabilities visually stand out when their cumulative AE
# count is plotted against the average AE count of all sites.
#
# - Simulate 4 Studies with 100 patients over 10 sites with 10 patients per site
#   for which 3 sites are under-reporting AEs with either 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%.
# - Test Simulation, count AEs at all sites, check that AE under-reporting sites
#   have fewer AEs as expected
# - Apply {simaerep}
# - Test AE under-reporting probability, needs to increase for sites with higher
#   percentages of AE under-reporting.
# - Generate Plots for Test Cases
# - Visually inspect plots and set them up as reference plots for unit testing.
#   Plot integrity will be tested, every change on the plots requires repeated
#   visual inspection.
