Simulate subject-level event reporting of clinical trial sites with the goal of detecting over- and under-reporting.

Monitoring reporting rates of subject-level clinical events (e.g.
adverse events, protocol deviations) reported by clinical trial sites is an
important aspect of risk-based quality monitoring strategy. Sites that are 
under-reporting or over-reporting events can be detected using bootstrap
simulations during which patients are redistributed between sites. Site-specific
distributions of event reporting rates  are generated that are used to assign
probabilities to the observed reporting rates.
  
The method is inspired by the 'infer' R package and Allen Downey's blog article: ["There is only one test!"](
http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/05/there-is-only-one-test.html).

## Installation

### CRAN

``` r
install.packages("simaerep")
```

### Development Version

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("openpharma/simaerep")
```

## IMPALA

`simaerep` has been published as workproduct of the Inter-Company Quality Analytics ([IMPALA](https://impala-consortium.org/)) consortium. IMPALA aims to engage with Health Authorities inspectors on defining guiding principles for the use of advanced analytics to complement, enhance and accelerate current QA practices. `simaerep` has initially been developed at Roche but is currently evaluated by other companies across the industry to complement their quality assurance activities ([see testimonials](https://impala-consortium.org/clinical-safety-reporting-work-product-stream/)).

## {gsm.simaerep}

We have created an extension [gsm.simaerep](https://github.com/IMPALA-Consortium/gsm.simaerep) so that `simaerep` event reporting probabilities can be added to good statistical monitoring [gsm.core](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.core) reports.

## Application

Calculate patient-level event reporting probabilities and the difference to the expected number of events on a simulated data set with 2 under-reporting sites.

```{r fig.width=10}

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(simaerep))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))

set.seed(1)

df_visit <- sim_test_data_study(
  n_pat = 1000, # number of patients in study
  n_sites = 100, # number of sites in study
  ratio_out = 0.02, # ratio of sites with outlier
  factor_event_rate = -0.5, # rate of under-reporting
  # non-constant event rates based on gamma distribution
  event_rates = (dgamma(seq(1, 20, 0.5), shape = 5, rate = 2) * 5) + 0.1,
  max_visit = 20,
  max_visit_sd = 10
)

df_visit$study_id <- "A"

df_visit %>%
  select(study_id, site_id, patient_id, visit, n_event) %>%
  head(25) %>%
  knitr::kable()


evrep <- simaerep(df_visit, mult_corr = TRUE)

plot(evrep, study = "A")
```

*Left panel shows mean cumulative event reporting per site (blue lines) agains mean cumulative event reporting of the entire study (golden line). Sites with either high under-reporting (negative probabilities) or high over-reporting (positive probabilities) are marked by grey dots and plotted in additional panels on the right. N denotes the number of sites. Right panel shows individual sites with total patient cumulative counts as grey lines. N denotes the number of patients, the percentage the under- and over-reporting probability and \u0394 denotes the difference compared to the expected number of events.*


## In Database Calculation

The [inframe](https://openpharma.github.io/simaerep/articles/inframe.html) algorithm uses only `dbplyr` compatible table operations and can be executed within a database backend as we demonstrate here using `duckdb`.

However, we need to provide a in database table that has as many rows as the desired replications in our simulation, instead of providing an integer for the `r` parameter.

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = ":memory:")
df_r <- tibble(rep = seq(1, 1000))

dplyr::copy_to(con, df_visit, "visit")
dplyr::copy_to(con, df_r, "r")

tbl_visit <- tbl(con, "visit")
tbl_r <- tbl(con, "r")

evrep <- simaerep(
  tbl_visit,
  r = tbl_r
)

plot(evrep, study = "A")

DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```
